# Awesome Notion Site

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
This website uses [notion-api-worker](https://github.com/splitbee/notion-api-worker) to fetch data from Notion. It will fetch categories and mocks data first, then open the server (use 2 files fetchMocks.js & fetchConfig.js)
